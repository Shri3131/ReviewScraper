Here the web-scraper scrapes the reviews based on the key-word from "Flipkart" and is displayed in tabular-format in a web-page.
The code is then deployed in Pivotal Web Services and Heroku.
The url for Pivotal Web Services is : https://reviewscrapper-funny-bilby-jp.cfapps.io/
The url for app deployed in Heroku is : https://sheltered-lake-12995.herokuapp.com/

This is inspired from lectures of iNeuron.
